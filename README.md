# Cracking the SQL Interview


## A comprehensive guide before your next interview

1. SQL was developed as an integral part of

SQL - Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

Although SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!

What Can SQL do?

SQL can execute queries against a database
SQL can retrieve data from a database
SQL can insert records in a database
SQL can update records in a database
SQL can delete records from a database
SQL can create new databases
SQL can create new tables in a database
SQL can create stored procedures in a database
SQL can create views in a database
SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

2. What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL lets you access and manipulate databases. SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard.

3. SQL is (referring to it as a Programming Language)

SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without the specific details about how to accomplish the task. The steps required to execute SQL statements are handled transparently by the SQL database. Sometimes SQL is characterized as non-procedural because procedural languages generally require the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading and searching indexes, or flushing buffers and writing data to filesystems. Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations aren't specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server process that executes it.

4. Which of the following is NOT a SQL command? (SELECT, REMOVE, UPDATE, INSERT)

REMOVE is not a valid SQL command.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands

SELECT - extracts data from a database


UPDATE - updates data in a database


DELETE - deletes data from a database


INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database


CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database


ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database


CREATE TABLE - creates a new table


ALTER TABLE - modifies a table


DROP TABLE - deletes a table


CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)


DROP INDEX - deletes an index
